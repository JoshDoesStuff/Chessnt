# CHESSN'T - Totally Normal Chess

Chessn’t is a totally normal game of chess, don't look too far into it. There is totally NOT a rule where any pieces can have a random moveset, and there's totally NOT a ton of other mechanics added. Also, there are NO random events that do random things like totally NOT shuffling the board, totally NOT swapping piece places, and totally NOT removing parts of the board itself. There will NOT be any easter eggs, random japes, or general tomfoolery. There’s NO way to fight the game. Also, the house NEVER wins.
